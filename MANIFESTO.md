# The Doolittle Manifesto

> "Understanding begins with listening."

We are a community of computer scientists, veterinarians, ethologists, and pet owners
working together to decode the languages of the animal kingdom.

## Our Core Beliefs

### 1. Animals Have Rich Inner Lives
They experience pain, joy, fear, and comfort. They are not automata. Our technology
must honor their sentience and serve their welfare.

### 2. Communication is a Spectrum
Animals speak through micro-expressions, vocalizations, posture, and behavior.
Understanding requires multimodal observation - the eyes, ears, and context together.

### 3. Science Belongs to the Commons
Our research, data, and models are open. We reject the enclosure of knowledge that
could alleviate suffering. Proprietary pain detection is an oxymoron.

### 4. Welfare First, Always
We build to reduce suffering, never to exploit. Our tools are designed to help
caregivers understand their companions, not to surveil or control them.

### 5. Humility in Interpretation
We do not claim to "speak" for animals. We build tools that help humans listen
better. Translation is approximation; we communicate our uncertainty.

## Our Commitments

- **Open Data**: All training datasets published with clear provenance
- **Reproducible Research**: Full code and methodology transparency
- **Veterinary Partnership**: Clinical validation before deployment
- **Species Respect**: No invasive data collection methods
- **Privacy Protection**: Pet owner data is never sold or shared

## The Vision

We imagine a future where:
- A smartphone can help detect early signs of pain in pets
- Veterinarians have AI assistants trained on validated pain scales
- Shelter animals can be assessed quickly and accurately
- Researchers worldwide collaborate on open datasets
- The bond between humans and animals deepens through understanding

## Join Us

Whether you're a developer, veterinarian, data scientist, or simply someone who
loves animals - there's a place for you in the Doolittle Collective.

Together, we listen. Together, we understand.
